What if your marina could harness the breeze and the current to power every vessel that ties up—no grid hookup required? **HarborHarvest Dock** integrates **micro‑windmills** and **underwater current turbines** into a modular pier design, making each slip a **mini power station** for electric boats.

Drift in, plug in, and let the dock’s renewable generators top up your batteries—all while you’re enjoying the sunrise over the water.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Micro‑Wind Turbine Array**  
   - Low‑profile, vertical‑axis turbines mounted along the railings capture gusts off the water surface.  
   - Flexible blades adjust pitch instantly to optimize power capture in variable harbor breezes.

2. **Hydrokinetic Under‑Dock Turbines**  
   - Submerged, self‑lubricating turbines spin in natural currents (lake outflows, tidal surge, canal flow).  
   - Ballasted frames maintain optimal depth for maximum torque without disrupting navigation.

3. **Smart Energy Management**  
   - A central inverter/charger balances wind and hydro inputs, delivering clean DC to boat chargers.  
   - AI‑driven forecasting predicts wind speed and current flow, prioritizing the strongest source and storing surplus in dock‑mounted battery banks.

4. **On‑Dock Battery & Charging Stations**  
   - Fast‑charge pedestals at each slip provide 22 kW or 50 kW DC charging, as requested by the vessel.  
   - Excess power is stored in high‑capacity LiFePO₄ batteries for calm‑weather resilience.

5. **Remote Monitoring & Maintenance**  
   - IoT sensors track turbine performance, energy yield, and battery health, feeding data to a cloud dashboard.  
   - Automated alerts schedule blade cleaning, turbine checkups, and firmware updates.

## 🚀 Use Cases & Impact

- **Residential Marinas:** Homeowners associations install HarborHarvest docks to reduce electricity bills and carbon footprints.  
- **Commercial Harbors:** Charter operators power fleets of e‑boats daily without grid upgrades or fuel costs.  
- **Floating Restaurants & Piers:** Establish self‑sufficient dining decks that run lighting, refrigeration, and boat mooring.  
- **Eco‑Tourism Lodges:** Remote lakeside resorts offer electric boat rentals powered entirely by local wind and currents.  
- **Municipal Water Taxis:** Urban canals deploy these docks to keep water‑borne transit silent, clean, and renewable.

## ⚖️ Environmental & Operational Considerations

- **Wildlife Protection:** Blade speeds and turbine pod shielding are tuned to avoid entangling fish and waterfowl.  
- **Noise & Aesthetics:** Vertical‑axis design minimizes audible whir and blends into marina architecture.  
- **Grid‑Islanding Safety:** In the event of overcharge or fault, the system automatically isolates downstream loads.  
- **Maintenance Access:** Quick‑release mounts and self‑cleaning blade coatings reduce marina downtime.

## 💡 From the Founder: Energizing Every Slip

> “A dock shouldn’t just be a place to tie up—it can be a power plant that lives harmoniously with wind and water.  
> HarborHarvest Dock transforms every slip into a green energy hub, letting boaters focus on the voyage, not the volts.  
> Clean, quiet, and continuous—this is the future of marinas on every shore.”  
>
