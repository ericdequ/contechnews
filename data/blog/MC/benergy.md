# 🚴‍♀️ Pedal to Power: The Peloton That Charges Your World

Let’s cut to the chase:

You’re already sweating.  
You’re already grinding.  
You’re already putting in the work.

So why isn’t your bike giving back?

Welcome to the next era of fitness and infrastructure—**Pedal to Power™**—a stationary bike experience that **tracks your output not just in calories burned, but in clean watts generated**.

In other words:  
**You are the power plant.**

## ⚡ What Is Pedal to Power™?

Think **Peloton**, but plugged into the **future of energy**.

- A sleek, resistance-tuned smart bike  
- Connected to a micro-generator in the flywheel  
- Paired with a real-time energy dashboard  
- Showing **calories burned**, **watts produced**, **devices powered**, and **carbon offset**

It’s not just a workout.  
It’s a **power session**—for your body *and* your home.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

We waste gigawatts of human effort every day in gyms that power nothing.

Imagine instead:

- Lighting your room while cycling
- Charging your phone as you train
- Feeding energy into your home battery system
- Selling power back to a neighborhood microgrid

**What if your sweat could fund your electric bill?**
